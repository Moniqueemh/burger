# Burger App!

### Overview

A burger app where you can create a burger log using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Node and MySQL are used to query and route data, while handlebars to generate HTML.

It lets users input names of burgers. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display on the left, waiting to be devoured. Each burger will also have a button. When the user clicks the button, the burger will be moved to the right side of the page. The app will store all data.
